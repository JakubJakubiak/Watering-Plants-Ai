During summer months, aim to maintain temperatures between 73.4°F and 75.2°F, ensuring that it does not drop below 59°F in winter. Kohleria is particularly sensitive to cold spells and drafts, which can be detrimental to its health.",
          "Humidity also plays a crucial role in keeping Kohleria healthy. While misting the leaves directly isn’t advised due to potential water stains, increasing ambient humidity will foster better growth. One effective way is to place the plant’s pot on a tray filled with moist pebbles, which aids in creating a more humid environment. Position your Kohleria away from radiators to prevent dry air from causing leaf curl and drop."

          "As a fast-growing shrub, Streptosolen Jamesonii can reach lengths exceeding two meters. Its drooping shoots make it a perfect candidate for a hanging basket or decorative pot, adding a cascading green and colorful display to any home or garden. One of the plant’s most enchanting features is the transformation of its flowers, which start as yellow blossoms and gradually change to bright orange, earning it the affectionate nickname “Marmalade Bush.”"
