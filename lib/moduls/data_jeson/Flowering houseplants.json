Routine removal of faded flowers encourages new growth and preserves the plant’s aesthetic appeal. Transplant azaleas every 2 to 3 years in spring or post-summer dormancy to refresh the soil and ensure optimal nutrient availability.",
          "Pruning azaleas from spring through June helps maintain their form and encourages healthy growth. Vigilance is also necessary in combating common pests such as spider mites. Additionally, insufficient moisture and overly dry air may lead to leaf drop, while proper hydration prevents such issues. Regular nutrient supply is vital; a lack thereof results in smaller upper leaves, while yellowing may indicate insufficiently acidic soil.",

Timely removal of faded peduncles is necessary to encourage new growth. Interestingly, the plant undergoes a rest period roughly from mid to late summer, during which time the leaves may die off. The bulb should be stored in a cool, dark place during this dormancy. Some growers note that the leaves may remain even if watering is reduced during this time. New growth resumes in September.",
          "Potential challenges in caring for Veltheimia include aphid infestations, scale insects, powdery mildew, and bulb rot. While not known to have air-purifying properties, it is not considered toxic, making it a safe and visually appealing addition to indoor spaces.",
