      "Growth rate": "Very high",
      "Lifespan": "Many years",
      "Temperature": "In the summer: it is optimum + 64,4-71,6 ° F, in winter it is desirable 57,2-60,8 ° F. In winter, in order to ensure flowering, a low temperature is desirable.",
      "Humidity": "The plant prefers high humidity, needs daily sprinkling with soft water. Due to insufficient humidity, buds may fall off.",
      "Lighting": "A bright light is required, the south-western window is best suited.",
      "The soil": "The plant thrives the most on breathable rich soil with a pH of 6.0-6.5, in a dense substrate you can add sand or perlite. For the soil of own preparation should be used: 1 part of the garden land, 1 part of coarse sand or perlite, 1 part of wet peat or humus (leaf ground), a little lime. Requires utensils with a hole.",
      "Watering": "Regular watering is required as the soil dries up, in the summer approximately every 3-4 days. In the winter, watering is limited, but the drying of the substrate should be avoided.With insufficient watering, the leaves may fade, but are easily restored after moistening.With systematic inadequate watering, the leaves may fall off. In case of excessive moisture possibly in a dense substrate root rot.",
      "How to fertilize": "From April to October use a complex mineral fertilizer at least once every 3-4 weeks.",
      "Reproduction": "The plant is propagated in spring with semi-matured apical stem caulis. It is best to take cuttings with 3 knots length of about 7-10 cm. Root in water or moist sand, peat or pearl at a temperature of not less than 71,6-75,2 ° F. Also propagate by seeds. For better germination, seeds can be pre-soaked using stimulants. Seeds are placed in a nutritious mixture.Germination occurs in about 1-16 days. Approximately 1.5 months later, plants can be transplanted into a permanent substrate. After 1-2 months in normal conditions, the first flowering begins.",
      "Bloom": "Flowers pink, yellow. Do not let water enter the buds, as this can cause them to fall off.",
      "Transplant and care": "First, young plants are transplanted annually. When they reach the age of 5-6 years, you can carry out a transplant less often – every 3-4 years. Every year only the upper layers of the soil are replaced. Do not immediately plant the plant in too large a dish, since in this case the root system will start to develop, and the flowering will come later. In summer, it is desirable to take a plant on a balcony or in a garden. In spring, the plant is cut off.",
      "Difficulties": "Exposed to pests: whitefly, aphids, spider mites, thrips.   Most often, the absence of flowering is associated with insufficient lighting, low humidity. Emerging buds may fall due to a lack of fertilizers or water on them. Also, dropping buds may be due to insufficient watering or feeding.   With constant inadequate watering, leaves may fall off. Leaves turn pale with a lack of nutrients in the soil. The plant is strongly stretched, the leaves become shallow with a lack of light.",
      "Beneficial features": "Young fruits and leaves of some species are edible, for example color or okra (Abelmoschus esculentus) is cultivated in India and some countries of Southern Europe.Abelmoschus moschatus seeds are used for making drinks, in Ayurvedic medicine and perfumery industry. Aybika (Abelmoschus manihot) used in Japan for washi, special grade paper origami, and also for manufacturing jute fibers.",

Young specimens are transplanted annually. It is better to use clay pots. It responds well to summer outdoor maintenance: the plant can be taken out on a balcony or in the garden. In spring it is desirable to prune the flower, but it is undesirable to cut off all the newly formed shoots of the past year to the base, it is necessary to leave them at least partially. It is required to delete all dead and damaged branches. It is also useful to pinch the plant during the growth period for its greater branching. At present, there are compact varieties that almost do not need formation. Can be grown in a bonsai culture. If you do not turn the pot during the growth period, the crown will be asymmetric.",

Sometimes fungicides are used to prevent the appearance of fungal infections. Germinate at a temperature of + 71,6-75,2 ° F, covering the dish with polyethylene. Germination lasts 2-3 weeks. Further, the seedlings are dived into separate pots. Adenia propagates vegetatively, by sprouting cuttings in a mixture of sphagnum and sand under polyethylene. Pre-cut the cuttings are treated with corn root, the cuttings are placed on a soft light. In plants obtained vegetatively, the caudex is not formed.",
      "Flowering": "Blossoms in June-August. Flowers are poorly decorative, pale yellow, creamy, greenish.",
      "Transplant and care": "Transplanted in spring in pots of a larger diameter as the roots fill the substrate: young plants every year, adults – every 2-3 years. Formed under the ground, the caudex during the transplantation is gradually cleared from the soil and carefully raised. The characteristic feature of adenia is the thickening of the trunk – caudex, which can be either underground or aboveground. Long shoots are cut, giving the plant a certain shape. Can be grown in a bonsai culture. The most common species are glauca adenia, A. spinosa, A. digitata.",

      "Reproduction": "They spread vegetatively with caulis cuttings, which easily take root. Cuttings are cut at an angle of about 45 °, before rooting, the lower casting is removed, and the upper ones are cut in half. A cut should have at least 2 interstices. Plant the cuttings in a mixture of peat and sand and place under a plastic bag.   You can germinate the seeds, including those obtained from fruits purchased at a store. To do this, slightly dry the flesh of the mature (sweet) fruit, carefully separate the seeds, to improve the germination, then they can be soaked for 4 days (the water should be changed every day), then, after mixing with moist sand, hold in the refrigerator for 2-4 weeks with periodical airing. Later, the seeds are sown in a steamed substrate, which must be covered with a film. The plants grown from the seeds are more stable, but it is important not to fill the seedlings and place the young immature plants in a bright light or under full shade conditions.   After germination, when the seedling reaches a height of about 50 cm, it will need a support that can be made in the form of a circular ladder. Shoots twist counter-clockwise. Actinidia is a dioecious plant, which means there are male and female specimens, which can not be distinguished before flowering. In order for the plant to begin to bear fruit, it is necessary to have vines of both sexes and to artificially pollinate female flowers, transferring pollen from males with a brush. In the room conditions, it is practically impossible to obtain fruits, since for the fruiting the plant must reach very large sizes for an apartment.",
      "Bloom": "Blooming beings after 3-4 years of life, but sometimes can bloom and much later. Female and male flowers differ externally.",
      "Transplant and care": "Actinidia requires a very large pot: up to 3 years, a volume of about 3 liters, then – no less than 10-12 liters. It is desirable to transplant the young plants without destroying the earthen lump.   Blooming occurs on the 4th-5th order of branching on the first five kidneys after the branch, so the plant is regularly cut over the 4-5 kidney. If you do not carry out pruning,  the Actinidia will grow as a vine or shrub drooping. It can also be grown as a compact shrub, and even as a tree stem.  Most varieties drop leaves for the winter.",
      "Difficulties": "The main pest affecting actinidia indoors the spider mite. This can be prevented by regular spraying and humidification of the air.",
      "Beneficial features": "The fruits of kiwi (named after rare, flightless birds from New Zealand) are widely used for food and have a huge supply of vitamins, sugars, fiber, pectins, microelements and zinc. The bark of actinidia has fortifying properties, and can also be used as an expectorant and sedative. The preparation of “Polygamol” was developed on the basis of actinidia.",
      "Toxicity": "Actinidia is not poisonous."

After 2-3 weeks, if the plant has adapted, it can be placed on the window.",
      "Bloom": "The flowers are orange, red, orange-red, greenish, pink, there are green-violet and red-black. Blooms in May-July. As the flowering stalks should be cut to prevent any seed – it will prolong the flowering period.",
      "Transplant and care": "A sufficiently large flower pot is needed, in which there should be a place for growth of the roots. Transplant before the growing season in the event that the roots have filled the entire volume of the pot. When transplanting, dried leaves are removed.  In summer, it is useful to take a flower to the garden or to the balcony, but to shelter it from the wind.",
      "Difficulties": "There may appear spider mites, mealybug.   The leaves turn yellow and fall when the roots are rotting and decaying. Also, with excessive moisture, the leaves may blacken. The lack of flowering can be associated with low lighting or warm winter content. When the light is low, the stems are drawn out and the color turns pale.",

      "Growth rate": "Low",
      "Lifespan": "Perennial",
      "Temperature": "In summer, the usual room temperature + 75,2-78,8 ° F is suitable, cattleya normally tolerates heat, but preferably not higher than + 89,6 ° F, since at higher temperatures young leaves may die. Being in the bright sun, it can suffer from overheating, so it is necessary to ensure air circulation. To do this, it is best to keep the flower in summer on the balcony or in front of the open window, but drafts should be avoided.   Also in a hot period, you should increase the humidity level, for example, using humidifiers, or placing the plant in a pallet with wet gravel (with the bottom of the pot to be in the saucer). In addition, with hot content, more frequent watering will be required.",
      "Humidity": "Different levels of humidity are required depending on the temperature, it should reach 40-70%. You can put pots with plants on pallets with wet claydite. However, with a cool content, especially in poor lighting, the humidity should not be high, as this can lead to the appearance of fungal infections or decay.",
      "Lighting": "The most important condition for flowering is a bright light. It is suitable for the southern and western window and a few hours a day of morning direct sunlight. The plant needs as much bright light, but can overheat under extreme heat. Therefore, only in conditions of intense heat (at a temperature of + 86 ° F and above) in the midday or afternoon, light shading will be required to avoid the occurrence of burns.   Under normal illumination, the plant has bright green leaves. Too light or yellowish color, hard leaves indicate an excess of light, too dark leaves appear in low light. Shading from bright sun is necessary for young and weak plants.",
      "The soil": "Suitable is a very loose substrate of bark pieces with addition of sphagnum and foam.",
      "Watering": "The intensity of moistening depends on the conditions of growth. In summer, watering should be frequent enough as the substrate dries. Although a single lack of watering is not critical for this orchid, one should not allow significant wrinkling of pseudobulbs. The best method of watering is the immersion method, when the pot is placed in a bowl with water.  During the growth period, you can periodically shower under running water. But this should not be done during the formation of buds.",
      "How to fertilize": "Fertilize only in the period of growth, when it starts using fertilizers with a high content of nitrogen, further apply top dressing with a higher amount of phosphorus and potassium.During the rest period and during flowering, no fertilizing is used.   With top dressing, you should be careful, as their excess can lead to the death of the roots and the entire plant.Also, an excess of fertilizers can lead to an increase in the vegetative mass and the absence of flowering.",
      "Reproduction": "Multiply by pseudobulb separation during transplantation. Each new product must contain at least 5.",
      "Bloom": "Flowering lasts about 3 weeks. Ensuring the flowering of the Cattleya is quite difficult. It is necessary to comply with all the rules of care, the most important of which is to provide a period of rest, bright light during the growth period, the correct light substrate, temperature drop. Only an adult plant with at least four mature pseudobulbs, as well as living roots, can blossom.\nIt is important for flowering to provide a period of rest, when growth is unacceptable. The time of rest period in different varieties and hybrids depends not on the season, but on the time of flowering. Those orchids that bloom in winter or spring are at rest from autumn to mid-winter. Those that blossom in autumn – early in winter, pass a period of rest immediately after flowering: from the end of winter to spring. During this period the flower should be kept in cool conditions, in a bright place, but not in a bright sun. Watered rarely, do not use top dressing, do not spray (it is better to put the pot in wet claydite).\nFlowers are unusually beautiful, have a variety of colors, except blue, have a pleasant aroma. When the bud develops, a cover first appears, which protects the bud from the external environment. However, the appearance of the cover is not yet a guarantee that the plant will blossom. With the slightest disturbance of care, the bud can blacken, and the plant will again start to grow. Cover and buds can not be sprayed during the formation. If new growths appear at the moment of ripening, some orchids recommend breaking them out. To prolong flowering, the plant after blossoming buds is best removed from the too bright sun.",
      "Transplant and care": "They are transplanted in the spring or in the period when the plant starts to develop new roots, or after new growths appear and they reach 2-3 cm. Cattleya does not tolerate transplantation and it is restored after it for a long time, therefore it is rarely performed, 3 years, in case the substrate has decomposed or the pot is too small. Gently squeeze the substrate with roots from the pot, wash it off. If the flower grows in a ceramic pot, in order to extract the roots from the substrate, separate it with a knife from the wall. If the pot is not valuable, then it is better to break it and take out the substrate with roots. Decayed roots are cut, processing slices with crushed coal. After that, the roots are dried. Before landing in the substrate from the bark, it is pre-soaked, after which the water is drained. Up to one third of the pot should be drainage from foam or broken pots.",
      "Difficulties": "The plant is resistant to pests. With excessive lighting, burns may appear in the idea of dry brown spots on the leaves. In this case, the reddening of the leaves is not a burn and usually harmless. Possible occurrence of fungal infections in conditions of excessive humidity.",

      "Fertilizer": "During the growth period (late summer – autumn), feed with a weak solution of fertilizer for cacti, diluted 4-6 times, every 4 weeks. The plant does not need a lot of mineral substances. In the rest period, do not feed. After the transplant, the plant can not be fed for 2 years.",
      "Reproduction": "Seed propagation is possible, although it is rather difficult. Seeds are very small, so they are sown with a piece of paper. It is desirable to plant in a container with a loose porous soil mixture with good drainage. From above it is better to pour a little sand, so that it barely covers the seeds. In the future, water them regularly and carefully so that the seeds do not surface (it is better to spray the soil). In case of stagnant moisture, the seeds can rot. After 3-4 weeks, tiny reddish seedlings appear, then watering is better reduced. A great danger at this time is the possible decay of sprouts with excessive watering. After 3-4 months, the first adult leaves appear, which soon wrinkle, but give rise to new ones. Sprouts should not be planted for about 2 years. they are very sensitive to transplant. Flowering can occur after 1-2 years. The plant multiplies by dividing plants when transplanted into 3-4 parts. The division is produced either at the end of the summer or during the flowering period. It is desirable that each piece had several pairs of leaves, although the plant can be obtained even from a single pair of leaves to the roots.",
      "Bloom": "It blooms with yellow, purple, pink, white flowers, mainly at the end of summer – in the autumn, sometimes in winter. In early summer, the plant is at rest",
      "Transfer": "In spring, every 3-4 years, the diameter of the pot is not more than 5-10 cm, the depth is about 10 cm. It is best to transplant at a time when new young ones start to form from dry leaves.",
      "Features of care": "In summer, the conophytum is at rest: its leaves become dry and may even seem dead. At this time, the plant does not have to be taken out into the street, especially not to be allowed, its falling into the rain. At the end of summer the plant comes to life, new succulent juicy leaves appear from the wrinkled leaves.",
      "Difficulties": "It is affected most often by mealybugs. Root rot is possible with excessive watering. The leaves become colorless with a lack of light, the plant can die.",

      "Reproduction": "It propagates well vegetatively, but with this method of reproduction, there will not be a caudex at the base of the trunk. Therefore, seed reproduction is more often used.Seeds very quickly lose their germination. It is best to plant them immediately after ripening. Before sowing the seeds should be about half a day soaked in warm water.Planted in a mixture of peat and sand, pressing the seed into the substrate. Gently watered by sprinkling the soil from the spray gun. Shoots appear within a month. The first year they should not be seated. The next year, when transplanting, it is very cautious to handle root systems, because they are easily injured. Young plants quickly form a caudex.",
      "Bloom": "Flowers are unconscious in cassia, collected in umbellate or spicate inflorescences. Only adult plants bloom, rarely in the room. Several seeds are needed to produce seeds, because the plant is being pollinated crosswise. Fruits ripen about half a year.",
      "Transfer": "Initially transplanted about once a year. In the future, it is required to reduce the transplantation of an adult plant to 1 time in 2-3 years. The plant does not grow too much, therefore use a small fairly tight pot. For formation of the plants in the form of the bonsai at each transplant thickened roots placed higher above the soil surface.",
      "Features of care": "At the base of the plant there is a thickening – caudex. The plant grows fast enough and requires regular pruning. In the spring, its shoots can be shortened very much, they are also cut during the whole growing season. The plant looks more attractive when shoots growing from a thickened rhizome are constantly shortened almost to the ground.In summer, it is useful to take the plant on a balcony or garden.",
      "Difficulties": "When there is a lack of lighting, the plant quickly stretches. The roots and base of the trunk can decay from excessive watering. The plant is affected by aphids and spider mites.",

The plant is also spread by seeds. Seeds are sown in February-March and germinated at a temperature of 68 ° F.",
      "Bloom": "Flowers of blue color 1.2 cm in size are collected in drooping inflorescences. Later on the place of flowers, golden-orange berries are formed. Blooms from April to September.",
      "Transfer": "Young plants every year in April, slightly increasing the size of the pot. Adult plants can be transplanted every 2 years. It is better not to replant old plants, but to replace the top layer of the soil.",
      "Features of care": "Another name for the plant is a “room birch”. The plant is great for landscaping offices and children’s institutions. Plants should be cut off regularly in the spring, and pinch to form a bushy shape. However, shortly before the expected flowering, it is better not to run the monkey. Can be used for bonsai. It can also be grown as a half-ample plant. For best bloom it is good to give the plant a short period of rest in winter and keep it in cool conditions. In the summer it is desirable to take the plant in the garden or on the balcony, the duranta needs regular airing. Faded inflorescences should be cut off in time. Durant can be formed in the form of a stamping tree. To do this, the growing shoots are cut off by side shoots. As the seedlings grow, they give him a prop, tied to a peg. When the desired height is reached, the appendage is pricked. As it continues to grow, side shoots continue to be removed, while upper branches are cut off, giving the top a spherical shape.",
      "Difficulties": "The leaves are shallow, and the stems are stretched with a lack of light. The ends of the leaves wither, and the tops are twisted under insufficient watering or in too dry air. The plant does not bloom most often due to the lack of a cool wintering or lack of light. The leaves become pale, shoots are strongly stretched, when the plant needs fertilizing. It is affected by mites, aphids, mealybugs and quite often whiteflies.",
      "Air cleaning": "–",
      "Toxicity": "Both berries and leaves are poisonous, they can not be eaten. Skin contact with these plants can cause symptoms ranging from redness, itching and rash to painful blisters and skin burns."

      "Features of care": "The main difficulty is the formation of an attractive appearance of the plant. The plant should be subjected to severe pruning after flowering in late spring for branching. Erantemum refers to the short-day plants, reducing the length of the lighting in the fall is his incentive to bloom. Therefore it is necessary to make sure that the plants at this time do not receive additional artificial supplementary lighting.",
      "Difficulties": "Infestation of aphids, spider mites, mealybugs and whiteflies. The plant is strongly stretched and weakly blooms in low light. The ends of leaves dry up, on the leaves appear areas of dry brown tissue in bright light and dry air. If the lower leaves turn yellow and fall off with a damp and viscous soil, the plant is waterlogged, it should be transplanted into new soil, removing rotten roots. On the leaves may appear stains when watering with cold water. Sometimes excess humidity on leaves erantemuma surfacemay appear very small droplets of moisture, which presents no danger.",

      "Life form": "Herbaceous plants, small shrubs, occasionally there are tree-like forms.",
      "Family": "Ericaceae",
      "Origin and distribution": "In total there are about 860 species in the genus. Most of them (690) grow wild in South Africa, the rest – in Madagascar, in the Mediterranean, Europe.",
      "Ease of cultivation": "Difficult enough for room keeping",
      "The size": "Up to 30 cm tall",
      "Growth rate": "Low",
      "Lifespan": "Perennial",
      "Temperature": "The plant is kept in summer at a temperature of + 64,4-77 ° F. Like azaleas, this plant does not tolerate too high temperatures. In the heat, regular airing is required, since in too hot dry conditions leaves quickly fall off. However, a draft is harmful. In winter, a cool content (+ 46,4-53,6 ° F) is necessary. Very poorly tolerate both heat and lower temperatures",
      "Humidity": "At high temperatures, constant spraying is necessary, which also prevents the appearance of pests. But too humid air of greenhouses does not suit a plant",
      "Lighting": "Erica prefers bright sunlight, at least 6 hours of direct sun, a south or south-west window",
      "The soil": "It needs acidic soil with a pH of 4.5-5.5. Use a mixture of peat soil (5 parts), perlite (2 parts), garden soil, sand and compost (1 part). It can be added to the soil, and a bed of pine forest, pine needles and spruce bark. As a ready-made substrate, soil mixture for azaleas can be used. Requires good drainage.",
      "Watering": "Watered as the substrate dries to a depth of about 5 cm. Do not allow the plant to dry out. While it dumps buds and leaves, the plant may die after repeated over-drying. When watering, we must try to get water on the leaves, which prevents the occurrence of fungal diseases.",
      "How to fertilize": "Does not require a lot of fertilizer. It is desirable to occasionally apply top dressing for azaleas diluted with respect to the recommended dose. A large amount of fertilizer is harmful to heather. The plant does not fertilize during flowering",
      "Reproduction": "It is easiest to multiply by dividing the bush into parts. It should not be destroyed by an earthen cloud.",
      "Bloom": "The most popular species – Erica elegant (Erica gracilis) blooms from autumn to spring.Flowers – purple, pink, red, purple, in some species, white miniature bells. There are species blooming in spring, there are – blooming in summer and in winter",
      "Transplant and care": "Transplanted annually as the pot is filled with roots. Earth clod is preserved. When transplanting, do not overly embed the plant, as it threatens to rot, but too superficial planting is also undesirable. The pot is shallow, since the root system of the heaths is shallow.   In summer, it is advisable to take out on a balcony or garden, but you should protect the plant from strong winds.   Every spring it is necessary to carry out pruning, which will promote abundant branching and flowering",
      "Difficulties": "The main pests: spider mites, aphids. With a lack of lighting, the plant stretches and blooms poorly. Pale leaves and too slow growth can talk about a lack of nutrients. When over-drying and under too hot conditions, leaves are discarded",
      "Beneficial features": "Some species, such as Erica cinerea, are used for medicinal purposes, as a diuretic and anti-inflammatory agent in diseases of the genitourinary system.",

      "Transfer": "Every year in spring in a larger pot. As soon as the size of the pot is the maximum desired value, it is sufficient to change the top layer of the soil.",
      "Features of care": "Extruded plants need pruning, you can leave a height of 30 cm. The plant requires a support. In summer it is preferable to keep the plant on the balcony or in the garden.",
      "Difficulties": "In older plants, the fall of the lower leaves is a natural process, the plants need to be cut off. The leaves turn yellow due to over-moistening. Stretched-out twigs and small leaves are evidence of the lack of light. It is affected by spider mites, aphids, mealybugs. At low temperature, intensive watering and poor lighting plant may be infected with botrytis.",

      "Life form": "Succulent",
      "Family": "Aizoaceae – Aizoaceae",
      "Origin and distribution": "South Africa. In nature, there are 33 species, some are on the verge of extinction.",
      "Ease of cultivation": "Easy with small complexities",
      "The size": "Depending on the type of 5 to 15 cm tall",
      "Growth rate": "Low",
      "Lifespan": "Perennial",
      "Temperature": "Faukaria easily tolerates temperature changes, in summer it grows best at a temperature of + 77-86 ° F, although according to some data it can withstand even the heat up to + 122 ° F. In winter, for normal development, a low temperature of about + 41-50 ° F is needed, but the plant even tolerates a temperature drop of up to 33 and even 23 ° F.",
      "Humidity": "Dry air is better suited, spraying is not needed. If it is necessary to remove dust from the leaves, it is better to do this with a dry cloth",
      "Lighting": "Faukarya needs the brightest light for at least 3 hours of direct sun, it must be placed on the southern window. If there is not enough light, artificial illumination can be used.",
      "The soil": "A light breathable soil is necessary for succulents. It can be made up of a mixture of turf, leaf, peat and sand. Good drainage is necessary.",
      "Watering": "In the summer, watered as the earth’s coma is completely dry. In winter they water much less often, and if the plant is kept in cool conditions, it is not watered at all. Excessive hydration, especially in winter – the main danger, threatening the decay and death of plants.Do not use too cold water for irrigation. Also, when watering it is desirable to try not to fall on the leaves and the base of the sockets, so that the water does not stagnate in the axils of the leaves, which can lead to decay.",
      "How to fertilize": "Apply fertilizing for succulents, diluted approximately twice. Fertilize about once a month. In winter they do not fertilize.",
      "Reproduction": "Seed propagation is used, which is very small. Sprinkle them with the surface of the substrate from coarse sand or its mixture with peat and lightly sprinkled with soil. The substrate is sprayed. Cover with glass. Germinate in the warmth at a temperature of + 68-77 F, periodically spraying the substrate and regularly airing. Soil should not be too wet, but should not dry completely. Seedlings appear after 7-14 days. After the first two leaves appear, the seedlings are dived into a permanent substrate.  It is much easier to propagate the plant vegetatively. You can use the division into sockets when transplanting. Each separated baby with roots is dried and then planted in a permanent soil. If the children have no roots, then it should be dried for about 2 days, and then placed in a moist substrate.During the first month, do not expose to direct sun. The plant can be placed in a bright environment only when a new growth appears.   It is even easier to root cuttings cut from the parent plant at a right angle. On the mother plant, the slice is sprinkled with crushed charcoal, and on the cut off knife by a powder of a rooting stimulant. Dry the cutting within 24 hours. Further it is germinated in moist sand, the rooting lasts usually about three weeks.",
      "Bloom": "Faukarya blossoms in late summer – in autumn large (up to 5-8 cm) bright yellow flowers, flowering lasts for about two weeks. Flowers open in the morning and close in the evening.",
      "Transplant and care": "Adult plants are transplanted approximately every 2 years, when the pot becomes small for the plant, the young – every year. The pot should be wide and shallow. After transplantation, it is advisable not to water the plant for at least two weeks.   In summer, you can take out to the open air, but it is better to keep in the shade, as excessive sun exposure can lead to burns.",
      "Difficulties": "The main pests: spider mite, mealybug, aphids, rootworm. Lack of flowering is most often associated with insufficient coverage or keep warm in winter. In this case, the plant also stretches, the rosettes become less compact, and the leaves are shallow and pale.   Leaves turn black at the beginning of decay as a result of waterlogging. Also, the resulting drooping and light leaves may become a consequence of waterlogging in winter and spring. Affected leaves must be removed and used to prevent spraying the plant with a fungicide.   If the leaves become soft, it also serves as a sign of excessive watering when growing in heavy soil. It is necessary to remove the plant from this substrate, remove the affected rotted patches and dry it for several days. Then put the plant in a loose slightly moist substrate. Sometimes such plants can not be saved.",

      "Reproduction": "Late spring division by transplantation, trying not to damage the roots of the plant. It is necessary that each new plant has several leaves and 2-3 formed roots. Plant young plants are difficult enough, they should be placed in a warm and very humid place (you can put the pot in a tray with wet claydite and mark on the radiator). It is rare to propagate with seeds, which germinate at a temperature of 68-75,2 ° F.",
      "Bloom": "Blossoms in spring and summer. In the McCoy kalatei, violet, nondescript small flowers are formed; in other species, orange-red, white and yellow inflorescences (especially vivacious in saffron calatha).",
      "Transfer": "In February-March, young plants should be transplanted annually, the pot must be shallow, since the root system of the plant is superficial. The soil can not be too primed, so that the roots do not choke. In the future, transplanted every 2-4 years, as soon as the roots appear from the drainage hole.",
      "Features of care": "Qalat leaves, like all members of the family marantaceae, are formed on the night – this is normal. In summer, the plant can be taken out to the garden or to the balcony, but it should be protected from the wind. The plant does not like drafts and gas combustion products. Completely dried leaves should be removed in a timely manner. Wipe the leaves with either a soft dry cloth or a brush, since they are easily damaged. Plants love the moist hot air of the bathroom especially at a time when someone is taking a shower. The plant is well-grown in a group with other plants to increase air humidity.",
      "Difficulties": "When the air is dry, the tips of the leaves turn brown, the leaves can droop and wrinkle. Quite often, immediately after the heating is switched on in winter, the plant very quickly withers and dies. (In this case, you should continue to slightly water the plant and do not discard it.) In the spring, new leaves may appear from the remaining roots).In case of excessive illumination, the leaves can temporarily twist (they take a normal shape, if the plant immediately move away from the light), lose color and dry up, white-yellow spots may appear on the leaves. The leaves become sluggish and wither at too low a temperature or as a result of a temperature drop. The leaves are covered with dark spots as a result of over-moistening. Leaflets of leaves grow strongly when there is a lack of light. It is affected by a spider mite.",

      "Bloom": "Blossoms from July to October. Flowers have 6 wavy petals and long stamens, located in racemose inflorescences. Coloring varied: from white to lilac, lilac and red. An interesting feature of the camprethmia is that the color of the flower varies with the development and within a day: by evening it is darker. Often on one plant, flowers have different shades.",
      "Transfer": "Lagerstroemia is transplanted as the roots fill the substrate. With the rapid development of root systems, transshipment during the season is desirable. However, the size of the pot should not be very large, so the best flowering is observed in a small bowl.",
      "Features of care": "The plant requires regular pruning, which can be done in autumn after bloom or in spring.Flowering occurs only on the shoots of the current year. In early March, it is necessary to shorten shoots by about two-thirds. However, by the end of March, pruning must be completed in order to develop shoots with flower buds. You can pinch shoots for additional branching.   Lagestremia is suitable for bonsai.",
      "Difficulties": "Lagerstroemia is extremely resistant to pests. May be affected by powdery mildew when kept in stagnant air. To combat it, you can use fungicidal drugs, for example, foundation, “Gamair”. The plant often suffers from a lack of light. In this case, it does not bloom very much, shoots stretch.

      "Size and intensity of growth": "In nature, the tree reaches 3-6 m in height, and at home does not exceed 2-2.5 m.",
      "Lifespan": "In natural conditions papaya often lives up to 20 years, but in the room it is usually replaced after about 4 years.",
      "Temperature": "In the summer: the usual room temperature (about 64,4-75,2 ° F), easily transfers heat, however it is necessary to spend intensive spraying; In winter, the minimum temperature is + 60,8 ° F. Papaya is extremely intolerant to lower temperatures, especially it suffers watering and wet soil at low temperatures.",
      "Humidity": "It requires a very high level of humidity, dry air can cause drying of the leaves and even the death of the plant, especially in winter with heating on. It is necessary to use all methods of increasing humidity: frequent spraying, the content of the plant in a bowl with wet claydite (water should not contact the roots).",
      "Lighting": "Papaya needs bright light, its best location is on the south and south-west window. It is necessary to regularly turn the plant about a quarter of a turn, so it bends towards the source of illumination. When there is a lack of light, artificial illumination using lamps is used. It is especially necessary in winter.",
      "The soil": "Preferably loose, fertile soil, the pot should be with good drainage and a hole. It is better to use a weakly acidic (pH 6-6.5) substrate.",
      "Watering": "Watering papaya often, in the summer every 3-4 days, not allowing complete drying of the soil, only the upper layer should dry between moisturizing. At the same time, excessive watering (especially in the case of heavy soil) is also harmful, since it threatens to decay the root system. Use soft water at room temperature.",
      "How to fertilize": "The plant is fed at least once a month, from spring to autumn. Usually use complex balanced fertilizers, only during the flowering period, increase the dose of phosphorus and potassium. Papaya responds well to fertilizing with organic fertilizers.",
      "Reproduction": "The most common papaya is propagated with the help of seeds, which are extracted from the fruits purchased in the store. It is desirable that the seeds are as fresh as possible. Rinse off the pulp and dry them for about 24 hours on paper. Then immediately sow in a loose mixture of peat and sand or peat with perlite to a depth of 2 cm. Lightly moisturize and dig up with polyethylene, which needs to be opened for about an hour every day for ventilation. Germinate at a temperature of 75,2-77° F.   If ready seeds were purchased in the store, they are pre-soaked for a day. Seeds are characterized by very high germination. If they are fresh, then the germination can reach 90-100%. Germination lasts from 2 weeks to 2 months. Usually, the strongest sprouts are planted for further cultivation. The shoots are transplanted once and immediately into a fairly large pot.   According to different data, depending on care, the plant grown from the seed can bloom after six months – 3 years. It is best to carry out seed reproduction in early spring, so that during the growing season the plant grows and grows stronger.   Vegetative reproduction is more complex. Adult stem (with a trunk thickness of not less than 1.5 cm) should be cut into several pieces of 10-15 cm long, dry sections for 2-3 days and plant the cuttings in moist sand or other loose soil mixture. You can pre-process the cuts with a root.",

      "Transfer": "Transplanted as the pot is filled with roots each year in spring in a bowl of a larger size.Required drainage holes.   It is better to take a fairly heavy pot to avoid overturning it. For an adult 1.5-meter plant, the pot volume should be about 50 liters. However, the pots should be wide, but not very deep, as the papaya has a superficial root system.",
      "Features of care": "The plant removes damaged, old branches, pruning is not needed. The plant does not like drafts and does not tolerate temperature changes. In the summer it is desirable to take a pot on a balcony or in a garden where an adult tree can be placed in a bright sun, and young growth should be kept in the shadow of larger specimens. During the ripening of fruits, their color varies from green to yellow. Remove the fruits for consumption can only be when they are completely yellow and become slightly soft. The fruits of papaya contain the digestive enzyme papain.",
      "Difficulties": "Among the pests should be a spider mite, thrips, aphids and whitefly. It is also affected by powdery mildew. As the aging grows, the lower leaves turn yellow and fall off leaving a bare trunk. This is a normal process.",

      "Lifespan": "Perennial",
      "Temperature": "In summer and winter, pisonia should be grown warm (73,4-77 ​​° F). At a temperature a few degrees below the growth of pisonia is significantly slowed down. In winter, the plant should be protected from drafts and cold air.",
      "Humidity": "Increased. It is necessary to spray plants with soft water daily, preferably in the morning and in the evening. Especially need a high   humidity   in winter with heating on. It is desirable to place the plant in a tray with wet claydite.",
      "Lighting": "A sunny place, a southern window will suit. The plant needs directional light for at least 5 hours a day, but it should be shaded pisonia from the brightest scorching rays.Under insufficient illumination the leaves fall off, in case of excess light they turn yellow.",
      "The soil": "Ready ground is suitable   general purpose. It must be fertile, humus, water and breathable. For a soil of own preparation to take:   1 part peat and 1 part leaf soil, 1 part coarse sand. Good drainage is required.",
      "Watering": "Water abundantly, once a week in the summer, immersing the pot in the water (after that the water must be poured from the pan). The soil should be constantly slightly moist, but not wet. In winter, water no more often than every 8-12 days.",
      "Fertilizer": "From spring to autumn liquid balanced fertilizer every 3-4 weeks. It responds well to fertilizing with organic fertilizer.",

Adult plants are transplanted every 3-4 years, when the roots fill the entire substrate. The maximum diameter of the pot is 35 cm. Use a wide, low, best ceramic dish. For a plant, stagnant air is harmful, so it is better to take out a balcony in the summer.   Faded inflorescences are pruned together with the tips of shoots. In spring, shoots are usually shortened by about a quarter.",
      "Difficulties": "The plant, in general, is resistant to pests can be affected by aphids, phytophthora, black leg.\nYellowing of the leaves suggests alkalinization of the substrate. In this case, it is necessary to pour the soil with acidified water.",

      "Watering": "Watering is moderate, in hot weather conditions – abundant, up to 3 times a week, the soil between watering should dry to a depth of about 3 cm, but the substrate should not completely dry out. With insufficient moisture initially hang the leaves if the soil dries out completely, plant clears the lower leaves, the trunk laid bare. In winter, the intensity of irrigation reduces.",
      "How to fertilize": "Fertilize during the growing season with a complex fertilizer with an elevated phosphorus content approximately every 3 weeks. Particularly in need of additional fertilizing are young plants. Fertilizers with a high nitrogen content lead to an abundant growth of the vegetative mass, but flowering may not occur or be weak. At the end of the growth period, the top dressing is gradually reduced.",
      "Reproduction": "Propagate neodrevesnevshimi or semi-prefixed stem cuttings, which are cut in spring and rooted in a mixture of peat and sand, covered with polyethylene.   Can be propagated by seeds, which are sown in a mixture of peat and sand to the depth of about 3-4 mm. Place in a bright place, but not under direct sunlight. It is necessary to constantly moisten the substrate. Germination lasts approximately 3-4 weeks. After 1-2 months the seedlings can be placed closer to the light, but still not under direct rays and only on the 4th month they are put on a bright sun.",
      "Bloom": "It begins to bloom in the spring, blossoms abundantly throughout the summer. The flowers are yellow at first, then they turn bright orange. For a bright color of flowers streptosolen called “marmalade bush”.",
      "Transplant and care": "Needs a fairly frequent annual transplantation as the roots fill the pot. Sometimes it is possible to carry out transshipment in the summer, if the roots have appeared through the drainage hole.   It takes a regular pruning by one third every spring, it will promote better branching. You can also trim after flowering, new flowers appear on the shoots of the previous year. During growth, it is necessary to pinch. The paws need support. You can use a ladder for the plant or shoot the shoots on the supports on the wall. You can use wire supports in the form of a circle, braiding around them shoots. Sometimes a plant is formed in the form of a binder.",
      "Difficulties": "The main pests – aphids, spider mites, whitefly, scab. The lower leaves turn yellow and fall off with insufficient watering. Also, the leaves can turn yellow due to the low nitrogen content in the soil. The lack of flowering is mainly due to a lack of fertilizers or lighting.",

      "Life form": "Gymnastic",
      "Family": "Zamiaceae",
      "Origin": "Subtropical America",
      "Ease of cultivation": "Not very easy to grow a plant, but it can successfully grow with a florist with little experience,",
      "The size": "Up to 1.8 in width and height in room conditions.",
      "Growth rate": "Very low – often no more than 1 leaf per year, occasionally the plant gives 2 leaves.",
      "Lifespan": "Perennial",
      "Temperature": "In summer and winter: optimum 60,8-75,2 ° F. Zamia is thermophilic, it can withstand temperatures of 30,2 ° F, but for a short time.",
      "Humidity": "Suitable medium and low humidity",
      "Lighting": "The bright diffused light, it is best to place the plant in the south-west or south-east window, it is even better to take the plant in the garden in the summer and place it in the penumbra. From direct sunlight it is necessary to shade. For uniform development of the crown, it is desirable to periodically turn the plant. It tends to asymmetric development.",
      "The soil": "Ready-made primer “Palma” is suitable. Requires heavy clay soil with an admixture of organic, peat and sand. To take a lot homemade: 2 parts of humus, 1 part humus, 1 part of wet peat and humus (leaf earth), 1 part of coarse sand or perlite. Requires a pot with a hole and good drainage.",
      "Watering": "In the summer, every 6-15 days. It must be ensured that water does not accumulate in the pan. The soil between watering should dry a little (to a depth of 2-5 cm), the plant should not be poured. Watering should be substantially reduced in winter.",
      "Fertilizer": "Feed 1 time in spring and 1 time in summer.",
      "Reproduction": "It is possible to replicate with fresh seeds, which can not be obtained in room conditions. it is necessary to cross-pollinate male and female plants, but seeds can be purchased at the store. Seeds very quickly lose their germination (about a month), so immediately after their acquisition they are soaked overnight in water (its temperature is 86-95 ° F), sown in a mixture of peat and perlite (sand), lightly sprinkled with earth and sprouted under the film at a temperature 68-77 ° F. Each day, the greenhouse should be ventilated, taking off the film for 5 minutes. After germination, remove the film and put it in a lighted place. Seeds germinate very slowly (1-3 months) and seedlings grow just as slowly. The size of an adult zamia plant reaches only a few years. (One should be careful: seeds of zamia are poisonous!)",
      "Bloom": "Does not bloom. Instead of inflorescences, it forms cones in the form of cones.",
      "Transfer": "Young plants are transplanted as they grow into a larger pot. Adults – no more often than once in 4-6 years, it is better to change only the upper layer of the soil every year.The pot should be heavy to avoid turning over such a large plant.",
      "Features of care": "Avoid getting moisture in the base of the plant, which can cause it to rot. The most intensive growth of zamia occurs in the spring. At this time, it needs the brightest light. In the summer it is desirable to take a zamiu on the street. Zamiyu not want to trim, but need time to remove old dead leaves. Leaves should be wiped periodically with a damp cloth.",
      "Difficulties": "It is affected in conditions of low humidity by a spider mite, scutes. Gradual drying of the lower leaves is a natural process.Yellowing of leaves or their sharp fall is due to insufficient watering. Excessive watering and stagnant moisture leads to root rot.",
