As the bulb grows, gradually increase the pot size. Alternatively, leaves from larger plants can be planted in sand to form new bulbs at the base. Propagation by seeds is also effective; they should be sown in a sandy peat mixture at a depth of 3-4 mm, with sprouts typically appearing within 2-3 weeks. Plants grown from seeds generally flower after 3-4 years.",

Timely removal of faded peduncles is necessary to encourage new growth. Interestingly, the plant undergoes a rest period roughly from mid to late summer, during which time the leaves may die off. The bulb should be stored in a cool, dark place during this dormancy. Some growers note that the leaves may remain even if watering is reduced during this time. New growth resumes in September.",
          "Potential challenges in caring for Veltheimia include aphid infestations, scale insects, powdery mildew, and bulb rot. While not known to have air-purifying properties, it is not considered toxic, making it a safe and visually appealing addition to indoor spaces.",
          "Veltheimia stands as a testament to the beauty of South African flora. Despite requiring specific care conditions, the effort is well rewarded with stunning blooms that captivate any onlooker. Whether adorning a windowsill or enhancing a garden, this plant brings a touch of elegance and intrigue to any setting."

Offsets, or “children,” should be at least 15 cm tall with their own roots before replanting in small pots. Pot size can be gradually increased as they mature. Alternatively, Clivia can be grown from seeds kept at a consistent 64.4°F. Plant fresh seeds in a peat and sand mix, with seedlings typically sprouting within 4-6 weeks. Once the first leaf forms, the young plants are moved to individual 7 cm pots, taking 3-4 years to flower."

Young Clivias can be transplanted annually, but reserve repotting mature plants for when roots outgrow their container. Change the topsoil every 3-4 years for adult plants instead of frequent repotting.",
          "Periodic maintenance involves regular wiping with a damp sponge post-flowering and pruning flower stems at their base. Allowing seed formation can weaken subsequent blooms, so it’s advisable to avoid it unless intending to propagate. Monitor for common pests like aphids, mealybugs, and scale insects, and address them promptly.",
          "In conclusion, the Clivia is a striking plant with its vibrant blooms and lush green foliage, offering visual appeal and a sense of accomplishment to those who nurture it.
